# Synapse Data Collector - Data Collection with External Sensors

This example collects data from two sensors that are internal to SNAP modules (temperature and power supply voltage) and two sensors
that are included in the EK2100 development kit. The [snappyatmega library](https://github.com/synapse-wireless/snappy-atmega) will 
handle the details of reading the internal sensors, while custom SNAPpy code will be used to read a light sensor and thermistor.

Please follow the [Data Collection with External Sensors](http://data-collector.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/example2.html) tutorial for more info on installing and running this example.
